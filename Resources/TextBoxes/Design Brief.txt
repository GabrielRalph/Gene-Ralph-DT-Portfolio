The design is in aim to address the limitations visually impaired individuals encounter in relation to recreational sports. The product is a solution for vision impaired individuals having sound activated climbing holds, audibly communicating to the climber where the locations of the holds are, and the next move in the climbing route, being a variant rock climbing system accessible to vision impaired individuals. The design will be installable to any climbing gym, and the holds will be able to be washed. The project will be a smaller scale prototype of the design having fewer holds than a conventional climbing route.
