Through experimentation and testing I developed and established sections of my design that would effectively allow for a clear ascent of the climbing wall. I evaluated a clear route algorithm that was to be implemented into a code, this was to allow for my vibrating motors to clearly indicate the correct climbing holds in order to asence the climbing route. I successfully formed a climbing hold to have a large lip that would allow for the best possible grip enabling a climbing route. Additionally i experimented with textures and applied the best possible texture in applying friction, this enables a strong grip amongst the climbing holds. Overall I established and applied many aspects of experimentation to achieve the goal of route climbability, although these aspeacts were not completely merged together to finish a successful finished prototype, this prevented me from completely achieving this criteria. The overall completion of the climbability of my MDP was severely impacted due to COVID-19 and although I did finiles my prototype, I achieved success in the aspects of design I was able to complete with the limited resources, equipment and advice stripped due to COVID-19.
