Through the budget allocated to my finance plan, I was able to successfully purchase essential and important items towards my MDP. This saved the money allocated towards my project and forced good practice throughout the purchasing of items. Although due to Covid-19 it forced  difficulicultys upon purchasing items and practicing correct time management. The purchasing of products became extremely difficult, without the communicative guidance of customer services purchasing the correct and optimal items used in my MDP was extremely difficult, this inforced extensive research to solely find the desired product, having limitations surrounding clear views of items, the country, postage time and website legitimacy, let alone gathering information on what would actually be a suitable product. An example can be seen in the correct carving foam, the right silicone and resin to be used in the creation of my climbing hold and many more items. Covid-19 also affected the cost and variety of items. Products were only sourceable from Australia as posting times were too long, additionally the extra costs of postage totalled to $130 due to express shipping being detrimental to the finance plan and time of construction. Lastly the time items take to be delivered were completely randomised from website to location, due to this it often caused severe delays in production time as if one of the several items needed to perform a task was delivered but the other items were not the whole sector of experimentation or development was paused until the items needed were to arrive, causing delays of up to 14 days, being a recurring issue throughout the development of my MDP.
