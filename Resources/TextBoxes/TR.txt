COVID-19 severely restricted the access to equipment throughout my design process. I was not able to have easy access to a 3D printer, this was to be used in the formation of my electronic housing that was to be detachable from the climbing hold and achieve my criteria. Through the limited access of the 3D printer I could not conduct experimentation, therefore completely stunting my development of the electronic housing. As this design element's progression was halted I could not successfully achieve water resistance within the technology of my climbing hold.
