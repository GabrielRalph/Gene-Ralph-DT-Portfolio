A test conducted through Engel-Yeger B and Hamed-Daher S on ‘Comparing participation in out of school activities between children with visual impairments, children with hearing impairments and typical peers’ in 2013 stated that through their 70 children tested (25 hearing impairment, 20 visual impairment and 25 typical pears) the engagement level of those who were impaired was significantly lower than those of typical peers, in addition the limited participation was emphasized amongst the visually impaired test subjects.
