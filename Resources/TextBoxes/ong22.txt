Through extensive experimentation I evaluated all aspects of my design and applied each development. I successfully applied and evaluated the most effective methods in determining if the climbing hold is being held. I evaluated the most suitable texture used for my climbing hold. I evaluated the most efficient route algorithm to be used in the formation of coding the climbing holds. I determined the most effective sound output and manner of application. And lastly I successfully evaluated the most efficient and effective size of my climbing hold. Throughout this experimentation and testing I progressively applied the knowledge and practice to my final prototype, forming a refined efficient and working small scale model. Therefore through this testing my final application will be to produce multiple climbing holds and apply the route algorithm, although due to COVID-19 restrictions, this final step in completing my project was stunted, i was no longer able to access resources, equipment and guidance this halted my primary research and development of my design, additionally this forced some aspects of design to stray from my success criteria. This can be seen in the electronic housing, due to equipment restraints i was no longer able to use a 3D-printer which was the tool that was going to be used to create this component.
