The use of two vibrators casted within the resin ensured the climbing holds effective ability to indicate its positioning. Through the use of vibrating motors they put out a high audible frequency and create vibrations that travel within the wall it is placed on. Through these features an individual with little or no vision can establish its position within an accurate range using the high frequency buzzing and the vibrations that travel from the mechanism. This area of criteria was established successfully whilst facing the resistive notions of COVID-19.
