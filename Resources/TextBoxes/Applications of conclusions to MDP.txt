Through the identified need I will design a product that provides an inclusive alternative to rock climbing to improve the physical health and range of sports for vision impaired individuals. I will apply this knowledge of the restrictions visually impaired individuals face and the negative health impacts it can catalyse, I will use it to drive my product and produce it to a high quality to ensure the effectiveness of my design.
