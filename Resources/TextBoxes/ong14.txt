Through the tools, resources and ideas used throughout my project it allowed me to develop my MDP, improving quality, effectiveness, and skill implemented into my design. Although these aspects used in my design furthered the quality of my project COVID-19 restricted tools, resources and ideas heavily, through this omnipresent restrictions enforced through COVID access to further these constructs where halted, this forced the development of my design to be restricted and consequently leading to a partially finished prototype. Although I was heavily constricted in the process of design, what was achieved through the whole process of my MDP was extremely successful. I managed to complete aspects of design to a high quality and efficient level, with the resources I had before COVID-19.
