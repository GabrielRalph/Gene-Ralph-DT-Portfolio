I composed extensive research and experimentation towards the sensors used in my climbing holds. This area of my design was the most complex and time consuming area of my project. This was through the unclear direction I had to take in order to complete this section. It forced me to indulge in extensive research and brainstorm ideas in implementing a certain type of technology to achieve this criteria. Through the experiments conducted I furthered my knowledge and understanding of capacitive technology and coding. I then successfully applied my evaluated experiments and built a capacitive sensor. This capacitor was a copper plate casted within the resin, when the hand or foot touches the hold your conductive limb reads as the other capacitor and through a coded algorithm I developed a technology that accurately and consistently can determine whether the hold is held or stood on. Lasty this process of development was conducted prior to the COVID-19 outbreak allowing me to achieve this feature of design with all the resources needed.
