The coding used throughout my MDP was a difficult and heavily time consuming process, I started this skill with relative novelty, it was a large learning curve for and it forced me to endure a lot of trial and error when attempting to allow the code to understand what I was trying to get it to do. Additionally when using Arduino ( a coding platform) i had to remember syntax, rules and grammar which was also a heavily time consuming process that felt as though i was learning a new language. Firstly I had to code the capacitive sensor reading panel so I could experiment clearly and evaluate the success of each sensor design. I then had to code an algorithm that effectively established when the hold was being held or stood on which took up many days of trial and error and attempting to understand functions. I coded a function that turned on the vibrators when they were touched. I coded a function that allowed the ESP32 chips to communicate with each other through their own wifi output.
