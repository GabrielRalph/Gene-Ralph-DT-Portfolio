Each time I undertook the process of creating a model it would exceed my expected time of construction by many hours, which progressively set me back in my time planning. Oftenly i would start my process at around 4PM after school and would be continuing late until the night leading to a tired day at school and often a late rise to my days, this theme continued throughout the process of developing me design and was further established during COVID-19, leading to a unhealthy living, that consisted of late rises, all day working and no relaxation. Not only was the process of creating models extremely time consuming but the art of forming moulds is quite tricky and one to be learnt over time through guidance from professionals. Through COVID-19 this guidance was halted and as my resin models got more complex there was no advice to seek apart from my confident brother who had as much knowledge as myself. This led to many mistakes in this process, these mistakes consisted of underestimation of the resin/silicone used to create my model, often forcing me to discard previous foam carvings, wasting precious time and resources, that became increasingly harder to gather through COVID-19. Overall this process of design was labourers, although I enjoyed the break from using my brain it would consume my energy and time throughout my MDP.
