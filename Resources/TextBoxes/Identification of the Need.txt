The personal and social need of recreational sport is limited within the blind community. As a young child going rock climbing was a common and exciting activity with my family, I pursued this sport and have been regularly climbing ever since. This experience should be shared by all people including those with disabilities such those that are visually impaired. The visual impairment of individuals limits the sports availability isolating them from average activities. The 2020 Victorian State Government Better Health organisation estimated there are 800 000 people in Australia blind or visually imapred in 2020, this massive demographic of individuals will be positively affected through the inclusivity of recreational activities.
