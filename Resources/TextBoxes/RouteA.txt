In the process of formulating my route algorithm I had to ensure its efficiency and effectiveness. my climbing holds had to know the climbing route that the user would follow when climbing the holds, as he climbing holds were to buzz when the climber was ready to make the next move up the wall each hold would need to know the climbers position and the order of the route to ensure the climber followed the correct procedure in finishing the climb. At first I thought that no route algorithm would be needed, I thought that once the climber places their hands and feet on the wall simply the next hold above them would buzz, but it wasn't as simple as that, firstly through my testing and visual representation of a complex climb i had recently filmed and completed it became clear that climbing routes never consisted of simple upwards movements, feet would be placed at random locations below your hand holds and sometimes a individual would move sideways, leap, reset hands to a lower hold and grab or stand on a non conventional hold. This made it clear to me that I had to come up with some sort of code that would allow for any route I wanted to create. I began brainstorming ideas, this process was difficult to understand and apply to a practical code language so I began testing them in the practical setting of a climbing gym. After this process i realised the most effective algorithm i was to code in order allow my climbing holds to buzz at the right time to direct the climber towards the next move was to follow the chronological order of movements a climber makes. To elaborate, when a climber steps on a climbing hold and then moves their hands the order of their movement was to be numbered, recorded through the capacitive sensor, which would allow the ESP32 chip to establish when the climbing hold was held, once the rock climb was completed by a person that sets the climbing route this numbered order of movement would be repeated through my climbing holds and allow the climber to follow the exact steps that need to be taken when climbing the wall.
