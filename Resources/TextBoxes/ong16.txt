This skill in applying a logical algorithm to be coded into my climbing holds was strenuous and time consuming. Throughout establishing this skill, I attempted to brainstorm ideas, this was a long process that took hours to evaluate as it was extremely difficult to visualise and evaluate the success and effectiveness of each idea. After the brainstorming the experimentation helped me visualise and outline the most effective route algorithm. Although I established the route algorithm to be used in my code the effects of COVID-19 prevented me from applying it. As parts of my development was postponed through mainly the lack of resources and equipment I was unable to finish multiple holds or the main final prototype, which consequently forced me to focus on other processes of development which never concluded to applying the route algorithm.
