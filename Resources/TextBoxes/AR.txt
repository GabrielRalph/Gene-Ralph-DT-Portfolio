Through the developed route algorithm, my design would allow for a climbing setter(an individual which screws climbing holds into the wall to form their intended climbing route) to place the climbing holds and then proceed to climb the route they intend to be programmed within the climbing holds. Through my route algorithm it will establish and read the chronological order of holds used via the setter. Through the development of my algorithm my project could have an easily adjustable range of difficulty as the setter could climb a difficult or easy route. Although, this design feature was not applied within the final prototype due to COVID-19,s restrictions within my design development. Due to these limitations I could not successfully finiles these design features into a coherent model, as COVID-19 impinged on the development of all other features of design many design factors that were established could not be applied into a working model and therefore restricting the success of my criterias.
