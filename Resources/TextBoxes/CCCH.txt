The procedures in forming my climbing hold models was one of the most time consuming aspects of my design. Through this process I had to learn the procedures undertaken to form a quality casting. Through each cast it consisted of three major procedures to form each resin model. These processes consisted of first carving the model out of blue foam using nemours carving equipment such as knives, saws and sandpaper. Once the first aspect was done I then had to create a watertight box or shape that surrounded the carving, these processes were quite time consuming and tedious, they both required accuracy and precision. Lastly i would calculate the volume needed to fill the cast with silicone, measure the silicone components, mix them and poor them, This process was also difficult it required precise measurements of each silicone mixter and i would often end up with a mixture or ratio that did not allow the silicone to set, forcing me to remake my foam carving. Once these components were finished I would mix and pour my resin to create the final product.
