Through extensive primary and secondary research it was clear that in the current market surrounding rock climbing there is no product on the market that is attempting to establish the same need as me. Through this there is no considerable exploration of differences. throughout all climbing products they differ from strength based training, to small scale climbing walls, to bouldering walls to rope climbing. I could attempt to find similarities but they would have no relevance, in conclusion no climbing products share the same need as my own innovation so this section of the research would not be beneficial.
