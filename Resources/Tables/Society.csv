,,,,,,,,,,,,,"● The VIRC users within Australia will have an overall improved health within the society. Due to the physical practice of rock climbing it aids the health of the users.
● Through a society's healthier living due to VIRC it will reduce medical issues, ultimately reducing a society's economic losses. As there will be less hospital care for health conditions sourced from physical inactivity, like obesity.
● Through manufacturing and production of my design it requires many fields of expertise, such as the resin casting process, coding and the use technologie. This provides the community with many jobs.
● As my design is innovative and a new product to the market it encourages consumer culture, ultimately boosting the economy.
● The inclusive innovation of VIRC encourages a society to further their own business to include others who are restricted. Additionally highlighting a potential for business and companies to further their target range.
● By conducting extensive primary and secondary research on the products available to a society it ensured the development of VIRC acknowledged the intellectual property of others and did not practice acts of plagiarism
● VIRC is a product that applies to each and every country as the target market is prominent in every country, additionally the system relies on universal noises that do not require a specific language to understand. This ensures each society of the world could benefit form this product","● A society may become reliant on sound indicative rock climbing, restricting the user from being able to experiment on normal climbing walls and normal climbing gyms.
● Through the extensive water usage and air pollutants that climbing equipment such as ropes and harness produces it may affect the surrounding living conditions of a society.
● The Arduino coding software used in the production of my design is made sourced form a USA company so it does to provide economic support to Australian society.
● Due to the expensive nature of resin and the implementation of technology this product is quite expensive. Although it has a relatively similar price range to normal climbing holds, gyms or cheap climbing facilities may not be able to fund this investment negatively affecting the lower socioeconomic class."
