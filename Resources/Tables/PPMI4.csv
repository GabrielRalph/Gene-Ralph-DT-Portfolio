Positive,Minus,Improvement
This design has two holds depending on the direction the climbing hold is placed(one side is a rounded surface whilst the other is a lip) this widens the range of difficulty for my design.,"Although this design consists of two surfaces, the rounded edge is a far too difficult surface to grip. As my design is aimed at new climbers the rounded surface would be too difficult and would not be used.","Improve simplicity, ease of grip, and storage spacing to ensure all criterias are met."
