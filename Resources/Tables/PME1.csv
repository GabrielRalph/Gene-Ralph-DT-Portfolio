Positive,Minus,Evaluation
This design is quite simplistic and would be easily produced. The braille climbing holds could communicate the positioning of the next hold well,"Although this design is simplistic and accurate, it can only communicate the direction of the next hold and not the distance. Additionally the chalk applied to hands when climbing accumulates on climbing holds these lumps could potentially lose there prominent lump due to surrounding chalk","Although this design is very simplistic and effective in directing the position of the next climbing hold, it has no representation of distance, consequently this would restrict your freedom of climbing, as climbing is a creative sport that relays on each individual's choice of movement to reach the next hold, having a unclear knowledge of distance would restrict this freedom"
