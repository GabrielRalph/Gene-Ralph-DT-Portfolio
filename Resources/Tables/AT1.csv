Speakers:

Negative -
The space needed to house this product causes problems as it needs to be exposed to the listener and also takes up a large area of space which is restricted within a climbing hold.
The speaker also uses a large portion of electricity, lowering the lifetime of the technologie.
 As the speakers would be exposed from within the climbing hold it would not be a waterproof design causing problems as the holds get regularly power washed to ensure good grip on the holds.
These speakers would get clogged with hand chalk affecting its sound level and possibly breaking the speaker.
