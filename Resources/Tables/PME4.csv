"This design would accurately demonstrate each holds position on the wall, additionally due to the method of indication it most resembles the true nature of rock climbing as instead of seeing the holds you can hear them, providing freedom in the climbers decision on how to reach the climbing hold, instead of being directed in a direction seen in the previous designs",The sound being played may be too vague to gather an accurate positioning of the climbing holds,"Although the holds position may be vague due to the sound, through experimentation and testing with high and low register sounds as well as high frequency and low frequency an accurate sound can be determined. Through the similarities this design resembles to normal climbing and the potential to accurately reflect the positioning of climbing holds it is the most appropriate design in achieving my success criteria and need."
