Area to be Investigated,How will it be Investigated,Limitations,Importance
"Technology
ESP32 chip is a micro controller integrated with wifi and bluetooth.","● understanding features and systems of technology through research analysis.
● Interviewing professional with knowledge of ESP32 Technology.
● conducting primary research, experimentation and testing with the technology.",My limited knowledge of technology will make the use and understanding of this area to be difficult,"Through this item my system will reliably and successfully send signals to each climbing hold, allowing my design to activate the next alarm in the hold, this item will also allow for a functional design as cables will not be needed allowing the installation of the climbing holds to be efficient and have optional spacing and placement"
Existing climbing holds,"Through the contact of Indoor Climbing Gyms staff, I will examine and test holds to determine the most appropriate and develop an understanding of components and cost",Climbing holds are extremely expensive limiting the amount that can be purchased,The appropriate holds will ensure that the route of holds can be easily held onto by various individuals. The correct sized climbing hold is also needed to have enough space to house the technology.
"Laser, heat, capacitive and pressure sensor technology","Investigating existing sensor technology, laser, heat and pressure sensors through research and contact with people as well as testing and experimentation.","A lack of technology understanding. The shape of the climbing hold and the internal space is needed to be encountered to house the technology, limiting the choice of usable holds.",Determining the correct sensor to be fitted in the climbing hold will ensure the functionality of the design is met as it will successfully sense when a foot or hand is in contact with the hold.
Sound output technology,I will test different sound out putting models to determine the loudest noise output and gather information via internet research and verbal communication.,Through the size limitations of the climbing hold the level of sound that can be limited is restricted,"The correct speaker will determine if my design works correctly and is functional, through this the speakers must be loud enough for an individual to hear with additional background noises."
Skill development,"The development of my skill relating to technology, such as coding and construction will be investigated through physical teachings from a professional, internet research and experimentation and testing",my level of skills understanding and time and financial resources,The investigation of skill development determines the level of execution and the functionality contributing to certain elements of my design
Target audience,"Investigating the target audience for my design will be achieved through internet research,
surveying visually impaired individuals and interviewing existing visually impaired rock climbers",The accessibility and availability of visually impaired individuals will limit the process of research towards my target audience,The importance of having an in depth and correct understanding of my target audience determines whether my design will have a clear and desirable function
