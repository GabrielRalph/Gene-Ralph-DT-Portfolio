Description and ongoing Evaluation
"Throughout the process of design I implemented visual representations of data/information. This use of visual display forced myself to understand and visualise the information, which helped me build a conceptual understanding of my own knowledge. Additionally through visual information it enables the reader to interact with my information through visual techniques and reading. This enables the reader to be visually interested in my content furthering the success of my folio."
