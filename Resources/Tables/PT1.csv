,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Reference, 9",
,,,,,,,,,,,,,Intro,Three carving foam models were made with different textures and casted in resin to test the best texture.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,Aim,To determine the most suitable texture to be applied to my climbing hold
,,,,,,,,,,,,,Method,"Carve three different foam blocks

The first block was coated in sand

The second was sanded with a 500 grit sandpaper

The third was sanded with an 1000 grit sandpaper

Cast each carving in silicone

Pour each cast with wax and them with silicone"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,Results,"The sand coated model leads to quite a lot of sand residue on both the wax and resin cast. The 500 grit sandpaper was coarse but portrayed a slightly uneven texture, whilst the 1000 grit sandpaper was evenly rough and had the largest amount of friction when each resin cast was mimicked as though it was a climbing hold."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,Evaluation,The 1000 grit sandpaper formed the best texture. This was through the 1000 grit sandpaper creating the most divots throughout the resin cast forming the most friction.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,Applications of conclusions,Through this evaluation the 1000 grit sandpaper will be used to sand the final climbing hold models
,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Process of creation and final models.
The first model was the sand coated, second was the 500 grit and the third was the 1000 grit",<img src='./Resources/Images/E26.png' />
