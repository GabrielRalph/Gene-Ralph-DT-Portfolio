"Reference, 2, sub to experiment to Reference, 4",
Intro,This was a sub experiment conducted to form washers that were to be tested in the final capacitive sensor experiment
Aim,To create my own silicone washers
Method,"Carve foam into a washer shape have the same dimensions as the metal washers used for the capacitive sensor test

Carve two washers with different thickness

Create a mould and cast with silicone

Lubricate the mould with vaseline and poor silicone in the moulds"
Results,The silicone washers had the correct measurements and were well made resembling the exact shape of a washer >
Application Of Conclusions,Through this successful experiment the silicone washers will be tested amongst the other purchased washers
