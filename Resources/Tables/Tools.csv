Identification of resource,Use,Justification
Computer,"To provide access to research and virtually communicate with experienced individuals. I used my computer to program the ESP32 on Arduino, and virtually display concepts such and route algorithms",Through the accessible research and communication it allowed me to further my knowledge which I applied to the construction of design features. I was also able to develop components of my design using a computer.
Adobe illustrator,To allow the visual representation of constructs such as my route algorithm. To draw items of design features,"Through drawing items of my product using Adobe Illustrator, it provided a quality display of design features. Additionally it allowed me to visually view concepts, which furthered my understanding knowledge through a clear reflection of constructs"
Arduino,To receive sensor information from the ESP32 and visually display it using Arduino and reflect the display using LED light. To construct the technological features and processes of my ESP32 chip,Has allowed me to easily program and modify technological features of my design. Through Arduino i was able to further my understanding and code the sensor technology as well as access and apply features of the ESP32
Solder iron,To connect wires and solder features such as vibrators and the capacitor(copper plate) into a functional circuit,The solder iron allowed me to physically construct technological features of my design by melting solder(usually a mix of led and tin) and connecting certain wires together
Climbing Gym,The use of the climbing gym was to gather primary research and experiment in the setting my design was to be applied,"The climbing gym allowed me to test features of my design such as the sound output of my vibrators which outlined whether they would have enough clarity in a climbing gym. I tested the route algorithm in a practical setting outlining the effectiveness and practicality of the algorithm. Through using the climbing gym for many years i built a in depth understanding of the sport rock climbing, through this knowledge i was able to evaluate features of design such as the texture of the holds, the size and shape of the hold and the manner in which the climbing holds will be placed on the wall forming a route. I could determine these features as I knew the correct texture needed to form a frictional hold. It allowed me to know what hold shapes are easy and difficult to hold, enabling me to form the correct climbing hold for my target market. Through my in depth knowledge on rock climbing I could establish the correct climbing route that would be suitable for my target market. Finally through my extensive use of the climbing gym it guided every aspect of my design, allowing me to follow procedures with an accurate knowledge of its application, allowing me to have a clear view of the success criteria throughout the development of my design"
