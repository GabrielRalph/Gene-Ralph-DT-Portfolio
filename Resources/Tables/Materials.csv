,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Resin and silicone,To create my own casts of a practical climbing hold,This provided me with the option to customize the shape and quality of my climbing holds. Enabling me to design features such as sensor technology and vibrators to interlock with the climbing hold. Through the use of resin and silicone it also allowed me to adjust features of the climbing hold and technology to coherently and successfully work together.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Carving foam,Used to form and resemble the shape and texture to be applied to my climbing hold,"Through the use of carving foam it allowed me to mimic the exact texture that was desirable for my final climbing hold. It also helped me easily, accurately and efficiently form the shape of my climbing hold"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Climbing holds,"To provide an accurate and practical reference of climbing holds design features, such as strength, wall thickness and bolt placement","Through having examples of climbing holds it allowed me to constantly reference practical design features. For reference I formed my silicone washer and bought the metal washers to exactly fit the standard dimensions of climbing hold bolts, and bolt holes in the climbing hold. Additionally I could have a reference of where the bolt hole was placed in climbing holds allowing me to ensure the strength and safety of my climbing holds whilst adjusting the area it was placed to ensure a suitable space to house my technology."
