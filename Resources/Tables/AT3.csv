,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Reference, 12",
,,,,,,,,,,,,,Aim,To determine whether the resonating sound of the vibrating motor was louder if it was casted in resin
,,,,,,,,,,,,,Method,"Find a cylindrical object to use as cast

Poor a small layer of resin into the cut

Plac vibrating motor on top making sure the wires are facing upwards and not laying down

Poor the rest of the resin in the cup

Let dry and connect wires to battery

Firmly hold resin block to a wall or flat surface

Compare results to a vibrator that is not casted in resin"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,Evaluation,Through this experimentation it was clear that the resignation was louder when the vibrator was casted in resin. Although through evaluating the level sound that was made I concluded that two fibrators casted in resin will form the most optimal output of sound.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,Applications of conclusions,Through these results the vibrating motor will be applied within the cast of the climbing hold to ensure the loudest resonating sound.
