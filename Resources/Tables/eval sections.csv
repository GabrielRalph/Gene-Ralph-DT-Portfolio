Evaluated sections of folio,Development and Changes
Identification of the Need,
"Through this evidentiary collection, a need for inclusivity of physical activity for visually impaired individuals is evident. This is through the benefits of physical activity on all people, the limited participation of activities through all Australians and the low engagement of recreational activity in blind individuals.",The thorough research and identification of a need enabled me to pursue a design that establishes a clear need.
Survey Analysis,
Lastly the success and need of sound activated rock climbing is outlined and clear due to the open opinion of visually impaired individuals having positive results to the questions asked on the survey,This further outlined the need and enabled me to develop my design within the views and opinions of vision impaired individuals.
Areas of Investigation,
Through clearly outlining areas that need to be investigated it has allowed me to establish the procedures and process i need to undergo to complete my design,This allowed me to apply a structure and acknowledge the skills I needed to learn.
Criteria to Evaluate Success,
The evaluation of my criteria in achieving success has enabled a clear view and guideline to develop and create my design to the highest quality,Through this evaluation I could clearly apply a standard that would achieve success throughout my MDP development.
"Time, Action and Finance Plan",
"Through the budget allocated to my finance plan, I was able to successfully purchase essential and important items towards my MDP. This saved the money allocated towards my project and forced good practice throughout the purchasing of items",This enabled me to clearly view the disadvantages and restrictions I faced due to COVID-19.
Time and Action plan,
"The covid-19 outbreak severely challenged the process of forming my MDP practical and document wise. Covid-19 affected my mental health, primary research, resource accessibility, and lastly the accessibility to equipment. Through these issues my proposed time and action was severely thrown out of organisation, which established a incoherent process of design in turn stunting the planned development of my project",The evaluation of my time plan highlighted the severe effects of COVID-19 towards the time planning and management of my MDP.
Evidence of Creativity,
Through evaluating existing products it enabled me to have a clear view on the current climbing gym setting. Additional it allowed me to view concepts that could aid the inclusivity of rock climbing towards visually imapaired individuals,it highlighted that there were no established products that were similar to my own. Through the evaluation I had more determination and a larger source of ideas.
Initial sketches,
Through multiple iterations of concepts that were attempting to successfully achieve my needs and criteria i was able to establish the most effective design in achieving my goal,"This helped me progress my project, enabling me to focus on one idea and spark enthusiasm within my identified design."
Climbing Hold,
In evaluating each concept it enabled me to refine my climbing hold and establish which attributes will form the most effective design.,Through this evaluation it enabled me to gain a sense of progression and confidence towards the other aspects of design.
Electronic Housing,
"As i evaluated each housing component it enabled me to further understand each aspect of design and how they will be connected and dependent on each other, consequently leading to a refined electronic housing component","This enabled me to realise the multiple components of my design and their importance within each other. This made me realise my project was complex and skillful, additionally intimidating me."
Electronics,
Through designing each circuit board it enabled me to understand the components of technology and apply them to create my own circuit board,This evaluation aided my perspective on my design. As I was intimidated through the electronic housing when I evaluated this section of my folio it highlighted my successful development.
Consideration of Design Factors,
"Through extensive analysis of my design factors it enable me to establish all factors towards my design which helped me have a clear view and understanding of my project and its features, consequently improving the quality of my MDP","This provided me with a clear image towards all my design features, giving me clarity towards my process of design, and helping me develop my design with all features in mind."
Experimentation and Testing,
Through experimenting with various sensor technology it enabled me to gain an established understanding of the technology and further develop the effectiveness of use of sensor technology,Through evaluating the sensor technology experimentation it allowed me to further progress my project and be satisfied with my development and application of skill and time.
Route Algorithm,
"Through experimenting with the climbing route that my holds will use, I was able to visualise and apply algorithms into a practical application. This enabled me to understand and be able to apply the algorithm into a effective code",I was unconfident in applying my ideas into coding format and through this evaluation it allowed me to view my development positively and further progress with new strategies of application towards coding.
Physical Experimentation,
"Through experimenting and testing with the procedures undertaken to form resin moulds it enabled me to develop an understanding of the practice, which futherd the quality of the physical aspects of my design",The evaluation led to further development of other experimentations as I used resin moulds throughout all aspects of experimentation.
Vibrating Motors,
The experiments conducted on vibrating motors allowed me to further the quality and success of the audible components in my MDP,"This evaluation enabled me to gain confidence on each aspect of my design, it furthered the success and progression I achieved throughout my experimentation."
Final Evaluation,
"Through extensive experimentation I evaluated all aspects of my design and applied each development. I successfully applied and evaluated the most effective methods in determining if the climbing hold is being held. I evaluated the most suitable texture used for my climbing hold. I evaluated the most efficient route algorithm to be used in the formation of coding the climbing holds. I determined the most effective sound output and manner of application. And lastly I successfully evaluated the most efficient and effective size of my climbing hold. Throughout this experimentation and testing I progressively applied the knowledge and practice to my final prototype. Although due to COVID-19 restrictions, this final step in completing my project was stunted, i was no longer able to access resources, equipment and guidance this halted my primary research and development of my design",Through the process of writing this evaluation it highlighted the fact that I must move with pride and confidence that I achieved success in the areas that I could achieve. Additionally it allowed me to accept the disadvantages I faced due to COVID-19.
Identification and Justification of resources used,
"Through the tools, resources and ideas used throughout my project it allowed me to develop my MDP, improving quality, effectiveness, and skill implemented into my design. Although these aspects used in my design furthered the quality of my project COVID-19 restricted tools, resources and ideas heavily, through this omnipresent restrictions enforced through COVID access to further these constructs where halted, this forced the development of my design to be restricted and consequently leading to a partially finished prototype. Although I was heavily constricted in the process of design, what was achieved through the whole process of my MDP was extremely successful. I managed to complete aspects of design to a high quality and efficient level, with the resources I had before COVID-19.","Through this evaluating it allowed me to view the tools, resources and advice that was restricted from me due to COVID-19 additionally it allowed me to appreciate the successful application of the resources I could use."
Use of communication and presentation techniques,
"Communication and presentation techniques played a critical role in how I express and exhibit my designs, and how I visualized the information being expressed. Overall visual communication techniques were useful in providing me with representations of my high quality reflections of my rock climbing technology, concepts, and identified needs.","I gathered a clear view of the tools and techniques that aided my skill development, additionally the evaluation allowed me to feel as though I successfully managed to visually display information in my folio."
