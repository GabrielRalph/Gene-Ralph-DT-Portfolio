Intro,"Climbing holds were marked by tape and each hold had a number that resembled its chronological order in the route, this mimicked the route algorithm of the sound activated climbing holds"
Aim,To determine if any problems or unfactored issues would arise in the climbing route algorithm when tested in a practical setting
Method,"Tape each hold numbering them in the order they have been used

Climb the route multiple times observing any issues that may arise"
Results,"When attempting to re-climb the ordered route i released that certain holds were used more than once, as you would use it as a hand hold and then a foot hold, this problem may hinder the success of the route algorithm, as it puts the order in disarray if a chip is allocated as move 2 and 8"
Evaluation,Although there was an issue methods to negate it were easily realised
Applications of conclusions,Through this experimentation the issue was clearly outlined and allowed me to have a greater understanding of the route algorithm making the process of coding it easier and forming a higher quality code.
