,,,,,,,,,,,,,Intro,I carved a foam model of a hold that i was planning to use for my final product
,,,,,,,,,,,,,Aim,To determine a suitable climbing hold to be used for the production of my design
,,,,,,,,,,,,,Method,"Carve foam block using hacksaw, knives, and 1000 grit sandpaper

Cut out bolt hole

Place a dividing piece of cardboard down the middle to create a two part mold"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,Results,Through this experiment I realised the size of this model was far too large and would consume too much resin and silicone to make. Additionally due to the large lip protruding I realised I would have to create a two part mold which was two difficult with the resources used and did not work. Finally i ended up recarving this hold into a much smaller model
,,,,,,,,,,,,,Evaluation,Through evaluating this experiment I realised I need to rethink the scale size of my climbing hold. The construction process and materials used in this large scale model were far to expensive and time consuming
,,,,,,,,,,,,,Applications of conclusions,In my new model I will rescale my design to ensure time and resource efficiency as well as model quality as I don't need a two part mold.
