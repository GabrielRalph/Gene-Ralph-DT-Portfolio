,,,,,,,,,,,,,Design Brief,Final Project Against Proposal Evaluation
,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The design is in aim to address the limitations visually impaired individuals encounter in relation to recreational sports. The product is a solution for vision impaired individuals having sound activated climbing holds, audibly communicating to the climber where the locations of the holds are, and the next move in the climbing route, being a variant rock climbing system accessible to vision impaired individuals. The design will be installable to any climbing gym, and the holds will be able to be washed. The project will be a smaller scale prototype of the design having fewer holds than a conventional climbing route.","Through developing my product I feel I have achieved a skilful and extensive developmental progression. I am extremely pleased with aspects of the design like the capacitive sensor. This section tested my knowledge, patience and will power to the highest of extents, but I came out victorious with an effective, efficient and quality design feature that made me realise that through putting in extensive time and effort it results in great accomplishments. Overall I managed to develop most of the design features that would make up my design, all of these features were well experimented and evaluated, but i did not achieve every aspect that would form my design, resulting in an unfinished product, this instills a sense of failure amongst my design, although these unfinished sections were not within my control, COVID-19 stripped away accessibility to resources, everything was online and difficult to purchase, hard to find, inexplicit within a minor picture, additionally shipping time was elongated due to COVID-19, this forced the application of resources to be extremely difficult and undoable at times. COVID-19 forced a lockdown which disabled any use of equipment outside of your residence. Thus, due to these issues I was restricted from completing the other components of design, leaving me with an unfinished prototype.

Mothers Evaluation on my finalised project
“Gene has put in so much effort into this project, im proud of him, and what he has achieved even through these tough times”

Brothers evaluation
“you achieved a lot, you managed to complete some complex sections of design, but i have no finished design to see. COVID restricted you and it's a shame because you were on a good trajectory and your design had a great need and a large potential”"
