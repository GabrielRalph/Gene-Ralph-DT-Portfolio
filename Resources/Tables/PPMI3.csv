"The large ring protruding from the climbing hold would insure a very easily graspable object. Additionally the inner space has a large square which would provide the space needed for inner technology. In the middle of the hold there is an extra grabbable area that is designed for a more advanced climber due to its difficult grip, which in turn bordens the range of difficulty for my design.",Due to the complex structure of this climbing hold it would be time consuming and an inefficient process in forming the hold.,Simplify the design to ensure an efficient construction time.
