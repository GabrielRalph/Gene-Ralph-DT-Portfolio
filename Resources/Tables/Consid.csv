Design Factor,Design Factor Analysis,Applications of Conclusions
Ease of use,"Ease of use is a detrimental factor towards my MDP, as the product is targeted at vision impaired individuals the audible system must be an easily usable function so that the users are able to ascend the climbing wall. If my MDP reflects difficulty in use for the target audience the design may become obsolete. Considerable factors in achieving ease of use consist of 
● Loud clear audible indications 
● A route algorithm that provides a clear climbing path 
● easily climbable holds and moves that caters to a large range of anthropometric datas","In the process of designing my MDP I will form a climbing route that is simplistic and has little movements required in the process of ascending to ensure individuals with differing physics and climbing abilities will be able to ascend the route. I will additionally place multiple vibrating motors inside the resin cast, this will create a larger vibrating noise."
Climbing hold size an inner cavity,"The size of the climbing hold affects the amount of technology that can be fitted inside. Due to the size constraints of rock climbing holds this affects the battery size, amount of vibrating motors, and the placement of other technology. The holds must contain a sufficient amount of area to ensure
● A large battery providing a long lasting electricity supply 
● Numerous or large vibrating motor to ensure loud noise 
● Functional placement of other technology such as ESP32 chip and wires",When producing and designing my climbing holds I will create a large cavity inside the cast whilst ensuring structural strength. This will allow for less resign used saving costs and forming a large space to house electronics.
Portability,"The portability of the climbing holds are an important feature in ensuring the success of the design. As climbing holds are frequently taken off the climbing wall to be cleaned of dead skin and chalk as well as set back up as a new climbing route by the gym setters it is important that my design can be easily assembled and reassembled from the climbing wall. To ensure functional portability of the design the technology within the climbing holds must be
 ● Wireless 
 ● Easily detachable from within the climbing holds","When designing the housing for the electronics, I will design a casing that is easily detachable and detachable from within the hold cavity, this casing will be space efficient and fit in multiple hold shapes."
Process of attaching ropes,The design must be accessible to vision imapred individuals. Through this the attachment of the harness and connecting the ropes must be a safe and accessible process for the visually imapaired.,"My climbing holds will be placed under a self belaying rope, this will allow the vision impaired climbers to climb without the need of a partner, reducing the risks of blind belaying."
Size of Target market,"There are 800 000 people in Australia blind or visually imapred in 2020, this large demographic is the target market of my product, through this large demographic my MDP product will have the potential to be accessible and desirable within this range of individuals. This is through the physical benefits rock climbing reflects. It improves fitness through exercise and muscle fiber recruitment. Physical activity is also proven to aid mental health. Visually imapaired individuals will physical and mentally be benefited through the inclusive product of visually imapired rock climbing","Through this large demographic my product will be broad spread and be a universal product that is installable in every climbing gym. Through my MDP,s inclusion towards a hole new target market it will be desirable to every climbing gym around the world as it will broaden climbing gyms target market"
Cost,"Resin and silicone are expresnive resources. This heightens the expense of my climbing holds. Although the technology used within my product is relatively cheap. ESP32 chips range to about $14 online, battery chargers are around $32 and vibrators cost $5 dollars. Through bulk buying of these materials the cost will significantly lower. Once the design is established the climbing holds will be of similar price to normal climbing holds",Bulk buying the technology for mass manufacturers will ensure low prices on my product. Through these cheap prices my design will be desirable to all climbing gyms.
Weight,"As rock climbing holds need to be unscrewed and cleaned from climbing walls every 2 to 3 weeks due to dead skin and chalk accumulation. The weight of my climbing holds a great impact on the ease of attachability and detachability from the climbing wall. If the holds are too heavy, screwing them into the wall may be a time and energy consuming task, this goes hand in hand with detaching the holds. The impact of light holds will ensure a energy and time efficiency within in the tasks of cleaning and setting climbing routes","Through these impacts of weight towards my product I will eliminate any unneeded technology, and form a climbing hold that is structurally sound whilst hollow and not completely filled with resign."
Ergonomics,The impacts of ergonomics towards my climbing holds will determine the climb-ability and comfort of my design. If the holds have little ergonomics they may be uncomfortable to hold and difficult to grip. This will in turn create a nonfunctional design as even if the user can determine the positioning of the the climbing holds through sound they may not be able to grip the next hold,"Through these detrimental impacts towards my design I will form my holds to have a graspable and comfortable surface, this will be ensured through an even course texture on the resin. Additionally the holds will be a smoothly rounded shape that will snugly be fitted to a range of hand sizes and shapes. This rounded edge will fit underneath a curved hand in a ergonomic fashion"
Built in obsolescence,"Due to my target market, the users will be new to rock climbing. As rock climbers progress, their hands build calluses, their skin toughens, their tendons strengthen as well as their muscles and their technique browdens allowing them to climb difficult routes. This relates to the built in obsolescence of my design as at first my product will be designed to suit new climbers through the easily graspable holds and basic climbing route. Once my design has built an established market, visually imparied individuals will progress and the need for harder holds will be established.",Through the built in obsolescence and its impact towards my MDP i will ensure my holds to be easily held and the routes to be very basic. This will ensure the growing demand for my product
Energy,"As my climbing holds will be potentially used everyday for 9 hours for 3 to 2 weeks, the energy use of my holds have a large impact towards my design. My design must be energy efficient to ensure long lasting use. If my product consumes a large amount of energy the batteries will die frequently, this will be largely impactful as the holds will have to be dismantled from the wall to be recharged.","Through the energy impacts on my design, I will ensure a low energy use so that the holds will have a long use span. Through the use of vibrating motors it will save energy use in contrast to speakers and provide a long lasting product"
