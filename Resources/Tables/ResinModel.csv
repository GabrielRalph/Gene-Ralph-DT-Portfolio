Creating a Resin Model ,
"I carved the foam block first removing bulk with a saw and sharp knife, once this process was complete i continued to refine the object with a small knife, carving until i managed to make it as refined as possible, I would then sand the foam refining the object as best i could",<img src='./Resources/Images/A1.jpg' />
"Once the carving was finished I would fix the model down onto the piece of cardboard or platform I was to build the box or walling on. This method of fixation would differ from each model, as I would use different glue or strategies to fix the foam down depending on the size and weight of each model.",<img src='./Resources/Images/A2.jpg' />
"Once the model was fixed to the base I would build a wall casing, although the wall would change shape depending on the size of the object I would always ensure there was at least 15mm gap between the perimeter of the object and the casing. Once the casing was sealed and fixed to the base with either wax that was heated with a hair dryer i would mix and poor the silicone",<img src='./Resources/Images/A3.jpg' />  <img src='./Resources/Images/A4.jpg' />
After the silicone was set and the foam was removed I would mix and pour the resin.,<img src='./Resources/Images/A5.jpg' />
"After the resin was dried i would satisfyingly peel the silicone of the resin and was left with a model that perfectly resembled the foam carving.
This was the process undertaken through every resin model made throughout my project.",<img src='./Resources/Images/A6.jpg' />
