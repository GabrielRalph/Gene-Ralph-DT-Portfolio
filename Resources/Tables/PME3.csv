Positive,Minus,Evaluation
This design provides an accurate indication of the position of holds and the distance due to the multiple variables of (multiple buzzings indicating length) or its placement on the back(closer to back could indicate shorter distance). The design would create for a fun and immersing activity,"Due to the various anthropometric datas it would be difficult to make multiple suits for various body sizes, this factor is important as the suit would have to be tight in order to accurately feel the vibrating motors. Through the connected chords and multiple buzzers this design could be restrictive in movement and heavy.","Although this design displays strong attributes and could accurately indicate movements, the design is too elaborate and represents many difficult issues such as weight, restrictive movement and body size fitting."
