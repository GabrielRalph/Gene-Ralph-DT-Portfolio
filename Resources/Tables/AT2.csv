,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Reference, 11",
,,,,,,,,,,,,,Intro,This test was conducted through the two accessible and common vibrating motors
,,,,,,,,,,,,,Aim,To determine the loudest vibrating motor
,,,,,,,,,,,,,Method,"Connect the chords of a vibrator to a battery ensuring the battery's voltage is equivalent to the vibrators volt intake

Hold the vibrators up against a wall to here the resignation

Compare vibrators"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,Results,Although the sounds were quite similar the circular motor had a higher pitch and a louder sound output
,,,,,,,,,,,,,Evaluation,Through the experimentation it was determined that the circular motor was the most suitable vibrator for my project
,,,,,,,,,,,,,Applications of conclusions,"Through evaluating the loudest vibrating motor, the circular motor will be used in the creation of the final prototype"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Annotations: These are two different models of vibrators, each were pushed up against up a wall to test sound output.",  <img src='./Resources/Images/E30.png' />        <img src='./Resources/Images/E31.png' />
