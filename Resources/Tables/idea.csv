Identification of idea,Use,justification
Online Tutorials (YouTube/websites),"To gather information, skill development and an understanding of technology and other skills required in my development of MDP.",Aided me in the process of learning coding. Helped me understand the process of certain experiments and design elements. Allowed me to gather in depth understanding on certain factors of design.
Ideaspies,Gathering professional advice on the process of design.,Allowed me to gain information and guidance on developing a range of idies. Additionally i was given information on current technological situations and what device would be practical to applicate in my design
Sub prototypes of climbing hold and sensor technology,helping me to gather an in depth understanding on process of design and guided the production towards of design elements towards efficiency and quality,"Through prototyping elements of my design it allowed me to physically view and evaluate processes and products. Through this primary research i was able to adjust and apply my knowledge of previous prototypes, i used the information gathered to further the quality of my product"
