Product Summary,Positive,Minus,Improvement
"The kilter board is a small bouldering wall which can change its degree of angle, making routes harder if the board is angled lower. The kilter board also has many combinations of climbing routes which are chosen and displayed through lights in the climbing holds","Due to the vast combination of routes that can be climbed on the kilter board, combined with the various angles, there is a large range of climbing possibilities. Additionally due to the small scale of the kilter board the holds can all be felt building an established image for a visually impaired individual, allowing them to have a understanding of where the holds are on the wall","Although the kilter board is small, has a range of routes and indicative lighting, it is only useful to partially vision impaired individuals and even if the holds were all felt and a vision impaired climber new where the holds were the climbing route would not be outlined","Through an additional indicative aspect such as haptic sensors implemented into the route instead of lights, holds that used sound, electronic audible ques linked to a camera sensor, or a braille reading of the route the kilter board could broaden its accessibility to vision impaired individuals"
