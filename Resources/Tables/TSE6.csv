Intro,The capacitive sensor technology and vibrators were integrated into a test climbing hold
Aim,To determine the capabilities and success of the technology when placed in a resign cast of a actual climbing hold
Method,"Carve blue foam to form the climbing hold

Create a silicone cast of the blue foam

Panel beat copper plate to form a spherical surface

Solder a wire onto the copper plate

Paint the outside of the copperplate in resin

Solder the vibrators to wires, solder the copper plate to wires, once all wires are soldered insulate wires with electrical tape

Poor a small amount of resin in the cast once dried place the copper plate and vibrators in position

Poor the rest of the resign in the cast"
Results,"The capacitive sensor worked well within the resin although it wasn't as accurate as the previous test it performed to a satisfactory level. The vibrators worked when casted in the resin and made a high level of noise, although these vibrators could be louder to cater to the high noise levels of climbing gyms."
Evaluation,This experiment clarified the success of the technology when used within an actual climbing hold
Applications of conclusions,Through this investigation I will apply the technology used in this test in my final product as well as the methods used to apply the technology to the silicone mould.
