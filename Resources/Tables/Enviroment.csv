,,,,,,,,,,,,,"● As I designed the climbing hold to be as small as possible it reduces the amount of waste.
● Through designing the technology components to be as small and efficient as possible it reduces waste amounts.
● As I designed the power source to be rechargeable it reduces battery waste.
● The product uses the most optimal technology in using minimal electricity.
● Through parts of the technologie being casted in the resin it further ensures durability and its life span, creating for less production and waste.
● Even if the technology breaks, due to the replaceable and customizable nature of the technologie, it reduces the amount of waste as the whole product will not have to be thrown out.
● As the product can be installed anywhere, it has the possibility to be installed on an outside wall reducing electricity usage compared to indoor facilities.","● Due to the non biodegradable components of resin, this feature of my design will eventually contribute to landfill.
● The inner housing uses plastic 3D printed filaments which are additionally non-biodegradable and will also add to landfill.
● As the climbing holds are to be cleaned, and power washed every two to three weeks, this procedure will consume larger water usage, being a very wasteful procedure.
● The carving foam used to form the resin casts break up into small polystyrene particles which is a poisonous and hazardous material negatively affecting the environment.
● The carving foam is additionally non biodegradable and these carvings get discarded after use being a wasteful practice in producing the product.
● The silicone used when formatting the mould is additionally non biodegradable and will contribute to landfill.
● As VIRC is a product to be used indoors, many electrical procedures are used to form lighting, ventilation, temperature regulation and music outputs. This inside gym has a large electricity intake and will contribute to global warming.
● As the climbing gyms use plastic tags to create an account and to sign in, it will contribute to environmental waste as plastic is non biodegradable.
● To climb my product an individual needs to hire or buy a harness and additionally be clipped into a rope. These harnesses and ropes are produced using polyester filaments, as they are extremely strong and abrasion resistant fibers, these fibers make up the fabrics or weaves to be used in the rope or harness. Due to the non biodegradable equipment needed to use my product, it will contribute to the textile landfill.
● In addition to the polyester fibers used in the creation of the supporting equipment, the processes that go into forming the fibers and making the fabrics consumes extensive amounts of water wastage and creates air pollutants."
