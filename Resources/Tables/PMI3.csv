Product Summary,Positive,Minus,Improvement
"Two people are needed to climb a normal belaying system. One individual regulates the rope tension as the climber ascends, ensuring the rope will not allow them to drop further than a meter whilst the other partner climbs the wall",This provides an interactive experience and advice can be provided whilst climbing from the belayer. Additionally a climber may feel more comfortable with a human they trust regulating their tension as well as aiding the climber through making the rope tighter or looser depending on the climbers preference,"Due to the visual attention the partner must provide whilst belaying, this system may be inaccessible for a vision impaired individual","Through the modification of the belaying movement, the rope holder will be able to tighten the rope as they feel the tension release instead of visually seeing the rope loosen as the climber ascends, providing an inclusive option for the vision impaired"
