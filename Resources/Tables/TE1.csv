"Reference 1, sub experiment to Reference, 4",
Intro,This experiment was used to test the best lubricant applied to silicone while pouring silicone into a silicone mould. This is a sub experiment for finding the best washer to be used for the capacitive sensor test
Aim,To determine the most effective lubricant for a silicone cast
Method,"Use a scrap piece of silicone that was set 

Apply conditioner, vaseline and soap on separate areas of the scrap silicone 

Poor small drops of silicone on each separate lubricated area 

Once the silicone is set peel each drop of and determine which came of the easiest"
Results,"The conditioner came off with ease although some areas of the silicone drop were connected to the scrap silicone.
The soap was a poor lubricant as the drop of silicone was somewhat difficult to come off the scrap piece.
The vaseline worked well and the silicone came of the scrap piece cleanly and easily"
Evaluation,The vaseline was the most effective method of lubrication.
Application Of Conclusions,Through this experimentation vaseline will be used throughout my project when casting silicone in silicone moulds
