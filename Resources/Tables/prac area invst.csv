Criteria,Importance of Criteria,Impact if not achieved,Method of Evaluation
Climbing holds and route can be easily navigated and completed,"Highly important 
Reaching this criteria will eliminate any climbing restrictions in relation to skill, strength and size
This will guarantee an accessible climbing route to all ages and physiques","My design could become obsolete to certain demographics, being out of skill range for possible younger users and therefore limiting the audience and accessibility of my design",This criteria will be met if individuals with various physiques can all be able to finish or comfortably climb the set route. Evaluation will be through testing by the target audience
The technology accurately senses and detects when the climbing holds are being held or stood on.,"Highly important 
The importance of this criteria is to ensure that the climbing holds can correctly determine which holds at which time are being held or stood on allowing the system to correctly work",If this criteria is not met the design will fail to work being unable to detect whether pressure is being applied to holds therefore not being able to know where to indicate the next move,"Through experimentation and testing various technologies to create a successfully functioning sensor technology that will consistently read when pressure is applied to the hold.
Final evaluation would be the sensors accurately picking up on pressure"
