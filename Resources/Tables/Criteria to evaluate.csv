Criteria,Importance of Criteria,Impact if not achieved,Method of Evaluation
Climbing holds and routes can be easily navigated and completed.,"Highly important 
Reaching this criteria will eliminate any climbing restrictions in relation to skill, strength and size
This will guarantee an accessible climbing route to all ages and physiques.","My design could become obsolete to certain demographics, being out of the skill range for possible younger users and therefore limiting the audience and accessibility of my design.",This criteria will be met if individuals with various physiques can all be able to finish or comfortably climb the set route. Evaluation will be through testing by the target audience.
The technology accurately senses and detects when the climbing holds are being held or stood on.,"Highly important 
The importance of this criteria is to ensure that the climbing holds can correctly determine which holds at which time are being held or stood on allowing the system to correctly work.",If this criteria is not met the design will fail to work being unable to detect whether pressure is being applied to holds therefore not being able to know where to indicate the next move.,"Through experimentation and testing various technologies to create a successfully functioning sensor technology that will consistently read when pressure is applied to the hold.
Final evaluation would be the sensors accurately picking up on pressure."
Accurately making sound indicating the position of the climbing hold.,"Highly important
This will ensure that the climber can be indicated of their next hand or feet movement through audio based alerts.",The design will be obsolete if this criteria is not met as the product will be unable to alert the climber of their next move.,This will be evaluated through individuals attempting to climb the route whilst blind folded yet clearly being able to identify the positionings of the holds via the audio based alarms. This will also be tested through visually impared individuals and with a level of background noise equal to that of a climbing gym setting.
Adjustability of climbing route difficulty.,"This widens the range of users for my design, being desirable to a high leveled climber as it can vary the level of difficulty and become challenging to any demographic, this can also satisfy the user as the routes can be varied in difficulty ensuring a challenging task.","This will impact the enjoyment of certain users, different people will climb at their own skill level and pace, the design would not be able to match every person's level leading to an unsatisfying activity.",This will be met if various individuals can be challenged through integrating a system that allows the user to adjust the climbing route level of difficulty.
Technology having no damaging effects from water.,As the climbing holds require regular cleaning of chalk and dead skin to ensure optimal friction the technology within my design must not be affected to ensure the design practicality and reliability.,"If this criteria is not achieved this climbing holds won't be able to be easily cleaned or cleaned at all, this will cause the holds to become polished overtime and consequently obsolete products as the user will have no friction when grasping the holds. Additionally if the holds are washed the technology will break and the climbing holds will no longer serve their intended need.","This will be met if the technology is waterproofed through certain finishes that encapsulate the electronics, or if the technology can be removable when in the process of cleaning."
