Product Summary,Positive,Minus,Improvement
"The Self Belaying device allows the climber to climb independently, allowing a climber to ascend without a partner holding the ropes and belaying",Self Belaying systems provide efficiency and safety when climbing in comparison to normal belaying devices. This system would enable a vision impaired individual to freely climb and eliminate the problematic process of a vision impaired individual belaying for a partner.,"When connecting the carabina clips attached to the rope onto your harness, if the clips are let go the rope will automatically ascend up the wall, requiring a staff member to retrieve the rope. This could become an issue for vision impaired individuals when attempting to clip in",To improve the design the self belaying rope must stay put when a climber is clipping in and not permanently rise or be activated
